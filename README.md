### Notes
-I was challenged with creating the MovieCell and formatting the layout. I had to think about how classes were intereconnected in Xcode. 
 -Another challenge was using the correct syntax and forggeting small parts like "!" but I'm learning how swift works. 
 -Also my app takes a while to launch, so I will look into how I can shorten the time and lessen the lag.
