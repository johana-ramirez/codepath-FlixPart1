### Notes
It was very interesting and fun adding more naviagation bars and controllers. I enjoyed seeing the flow of an app. I was challenged by implementing the correct flow of view controllers and navigation bars. In addition, I believe I can improve the app's visuals and design by adding a white bar where the navigation bar is when you click on a movie to check for more information. Overall, this project helped me understand how I can use APIs to extract specific information. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

### Notes
-I was challenged with creating the MovieCell and formatting the layout. I had to think about how classes were intereconnected in Xcode. 
 -Another challenge was using the correct syntax and forggeting small parts like "!" but I'm learning how swift works. 
 -Also my app takes a while to launch, so I will look into how I can shorten the time and lessen the lag.
